# Kalium

A tool made in high school as a total beginner to translate LaTeX expressions to calculators.

## Goals
- Improve workflow and reduce distractions

> [!WARNING]  
> The code is a dumpster fire and worked by mashing things together ASAP. The executable is provided while the translation code is not. Unless I clean it up.

## Supported calculators:
- TI-nspire CX-CAS calculator, with units
- SpeedCrunch, with units.
- Or just strip LaTeX to raw symbolic expressions.

## Screenshots
